# work_day_scheduler
The goal of this project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I will be using the Moment.js library for this application. The planner will display the current day and timeblocks that are color coded and indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can enter events into each timeblock which are then saved into local storage. I am the sole editor of this project and will be the only one writing code. This project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
